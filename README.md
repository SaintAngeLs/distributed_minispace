## üõ†Ô∏è Container Diagram
The C4 Container Diagram below provides a high-level overview of the MiniSpace system architecture:

![Container Diagram for MiniSpace System](docs/container_diagram_for_minispace_system.png)

This diagram showcases the critical containers (e.g., microservices, databases) that make up the MiniSpace system. The `API Gateway` serves as the primary entry point for users, routing requests through the `Fabio Load Balancer` to various specialized services such as the `Comments Service`, `Events Service`, `Friends Service`, and more. Each service interacts with its dedicated database, ensuring efficient data management. Additionally, monitoring and logging services like `Jaeger`, `Seq`, `Prometheus`, and `Grafana` are integrated to ensure system health and performance.

## üåê Complex System Diagram
The Complex System Diagram offers a detailed view of MiniSpace's infrastructure and the interactions between various components:

![General Diagram for MiniSpace System](docs/complex_system_diagram.png)

### üîë Key Concepts Illustrated:
- ‚è© **Event Sourcing**: All changes within the system are recorded as a sequence of immutable events (e.g., `CommentAddedEvent`, `EmailSentEvent`). This allows the system to rebuild its state from these events, ensuring data integrity and providing a complete historical record.
  
- ‚è© **Inbox/Outbox Pattern**: This pattern ensures reliable communication between microservices. The Outbox temporarily stores events before sending them to the message broker (`RabbitMQ`), ensuring that no events are lost. The Inbox ensures that messages are processed exactly once, preventing duplication.

- ‚è© **Choreographical Saga Pattern**: To handle long-running, complex transactions across multiple microservices, MiniSpace uses the Choreographical Saga Pattern. Each service in the transaction executes its local operation and then publishes an event to trigger the next service in the sequence. This decentralized approach ensures that transactions are robust, even in the event of partial failures.

### üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Components:
- ‚òëÔ∏è **API Gateway**: The central hub for handling incoming API requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **NGINX**: Acts as a reverse proxy, providing load balancing and enhanced security for incoming traffic.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **RabbitMQ (Event Bus)**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services, enabling decoupled and efficient interactions.
- ‚òëÔ∏è**Prometheus and Grafana**: Work together to monitor system metrics and visualize performance, ensuring reliability and uptime.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Jaeger**: Manages distributed tracing, allowing for end-to-end monitoring of requests across multiple services.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Seq**: Centralized logging system that simplifies monitoring and debugging of the entire infrastructure.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Consul**: Provides service discovery and configuration management, ensuring that services can dynamically find and communicate with each other.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **AWS S3**: Secure and scalable storage solution used by the `Media Files Service` for managing user-uploaded media.

### üí° Example Use Cases:
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Media Upload**: When a user uploads a media file, the `Media Files Service` processes and stores it in an S3 bucket. An event is then published to notify other services of the new media file.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Event Notification**: Upon the creation or update of an event, the `Notifications Service` sends real-time updates to users using SignalR, keeping them informed about upcoming activities.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Event Registration and Attendance**: A student discovers an upcoming coding workshop through MiniSpace. They register for the event via the platform, receiving instant confirmation and reminders through the `Notifications Service`. On the day of the event, the student checks in using the app, and the `Events Service` tracks their attendance, updating the organizer with real-time participant data.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Social Networking and Interaction**: A group of students interested in forming a study group uses MiniSpace to create a new event. The `Posts Service` allows them to share updates and schedules within the group, while the `Friends Service` helps them invite other students with similar academic interests. Reactions and comments foster engagement, making the study group dynamic and interactive.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Content Reporting and Moderation**: Suppose a student comes across inappropriate content on a public event post. Using the `Reports Service`, they can flag the content for review. The system logs the report and notifies the `Notifications Service`, which then alerts the moderators. Moderators can review the report and take necessary actions to ensure the platform remains safe and respectful.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Organizational Announcements**: A student organization wants to announce an upcoming charity drive. They create a post using the `Posts Service`, and it automatically notifies all members through the `Notifications Service`. The organization can track the post's engagement, such as likes and comments, via the `Reactions Service`, and gather insights into member participation.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Collaborative Media Sharing**: During a university festival, students upload photos and videos to the MiniSpace app. The `Media Files Service` stores these files securely in an AWS S3 bucket, while the `Notifications Service` alerts event participants about new media uploads. The event organizer can later download these files for use in promotional materials.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Custom Event Analytics**: After hosting a large seminar, the organizer uses MiniSpace‚Äôs analytics tools to review event success. By accessing data provided by the `Events Service` and `Prometheus`, they can see how many students attended, track peak engagement times, and review feedback collected via post-event surveys. This helps them plan even more successful events in the future.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Real-Time Event Feedback**: During a live event, students are encouraged to provide feedback using MiniSpace. As students submit their responses, the `Comments Service` captures their input in real-time, while the `Event Bus` ensures that feedback is stored and made available for immediate review by the event organizers.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Secure File Storage for Student Projects**: A class is using MiniSpace to manage group projects. Students upload their documents and project files through the `Media Files Service`, which are securely stored in an S3 bucket. The system ensures that only authorized group members have access to these files, maintaining the privacy and integrity of their work.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Dynamic Event Invitations**: A student receives a notification about an upcoming event that matches their interests. Using the `Friends Service`, they can instantly invite friends to join them. The system tracks RSVPs and sends reminders, ensuring that everyone is informed and ready to participate.

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Automated Email Communication**: An event organizer schedules a series of workshops and uses the `Email Service` to automate communication. The system sends out confirmation emails to registrants, reminder emails before each workshop, and follow-up emails with links to workshop recordings and additional resources.
